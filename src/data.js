    topTips: {
      one:"Spend a day exploring the sea on a boat trip. The local tours know the best spots for animal spotting", two:"Make sure your hotel is lower down the hill. The steep incline is not a fun trek in midday sun"

    description: "The history, the beauty, the food and the wine made this city getaway one of my favourites so far. Hitting Rome in a 40 degree heatwave was a new expirience, however with shade and access to endless taps it's easier compared to the UK. See the sites, taste the food, meet the people and explore history like you never have before.",

    topTips: {
      one:"Buy colosseum tickets before you go, you do not want to miss it and they usually sell out in advance", two:"Visit the Trevi Fountain early morning. We went at 6am and there were already others there so the earlier, the better to beat the crowds!"

    topTips: {
      one:"Get a Hamburg card! You get unlimited travel on the major routes and discounts at museums, restaurants and shops",
      two:"Get to the Elphi and grab a drink in one of the bars. Great views, not so cheap coctails but worth it for the view (as a former London-girl, it's a regular London cocktail price)"
